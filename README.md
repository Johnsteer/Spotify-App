# Spotify User Profile Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that displays insights about a user's Spotify profile. It consists of two main components:

1. **ETL Process**: A Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that pulls data from the Spotify Web API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
2. **Web Application**: A Svelte-based front-end application that retrieves data from the PostgreSQL database and presents it in an interactive dashboard.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

1. To gain practical experience in full-stack web development.
2. To learn and implement the Svelte framework for the front-end.
3. To work with data from external APIs (Spotify Web API).
4. To practice database design and management with PostgreSQL.
5. To improve skills in front-end design and data visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **ETL Process**:
  - Python
  - Docker
  - PostgreSQL
  - Spotify Web API
- **Web Application**:
  - Svelte
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Node.js

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

1. `etl/`: Contains the Python-based ETL process that interacts with the Spotify API and loads data into the PostgreSQL database.
2. `frontend/`: Contains the Svelte-based web application that displays the user's Spotify data in an interactive dashboard.

## Current Status

The project is in its initial stages. The ETL process has been implemented, and the front-end template has been created using HTML and CSS. The next steps involve:

1. Connecting the Svelte app to the PostgreSQL database.
2. Implementing data visualization components.
3. Adding interactivity to the dashboard.
4. Refining the design and user experience.

## Future Plans

- Implement user authentication.
- Add more detailed analytics and insights.
- Explore additional features of the Spotify API.
- Optimize performance and scalability.

## Acknowledgements

- The initial HTML/CSS template for the dashboard was created with assistance from Claude AI.
- This project uses data from the Spotify Web API.
